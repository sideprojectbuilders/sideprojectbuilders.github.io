# Web Development

## Various ways to create a web service

### Original Way

#### Front-end

Web services provide the information that users need.
The simplest form is pure text.
If you want to use some text formatting and links between pages, you should use HTML tags.
If you want to put beautiful designs on your page, you should use CSS.
If you want to add dynamics here, you should use Javascript.
HTML, CSS, and Javascript are called front-end languages.

#### Back-end

With front-end technology, you will be able to deliver information you have already created.
However, backend technology is required to allow users to produce and share information among themselves.
We can implement the backend in any programming language we know. For example, Python, Java, C ++, and JavaScript (Node.js) are all available.
It is not easy to build a backend from scratch with a simple programming language. So developers use a web frameworks. For example, Python has django and flask. Node.js has Express. Java has a Spring.
It takes a lot of prior knowledge to do all this ourselves. It is necessary to understand that such as computer science, programming language basics, how to use database, understanding of client server communication, web browser operating principles etc.

### Flipped Way

Taking these steps takes a lot of time and effort. So we can do it upside down. The youngest developer on Facebook is explaining it well.

Wordpress is very good starting point. With WordPress, even beginners can easily create Web services.
If you purchase a theme or download a free theme, you can make a very beautiful homepage without a designer.
WordPress basically provides blog features. However, you can use various plug-ins to implement unlimited functions.
You can build an online shopping mall using the Woocommerce plug-in, or build social media services such as Facebook and Twitter using the buddypress plug-in.
As you can see in the video, you can learn the language you need when you need to customize your WordPress website.

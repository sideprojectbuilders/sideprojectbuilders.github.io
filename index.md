# Web Development Study Group for Beginners

## Details

You have to bring a laptop. No prior knowledge required. Sometimes we can have mentors who are professional web developers, but basically, we will learn through open materials(documents and MOOC) and develop something we want to build at the same time.

We will help each other to:

1. be consistently motivated,
2. achieve our study plans,
3. find good materials to learn,
4. find the solution when we stuck,
5. realize our ideas.

I hope to make this meetup a good substitute for an expensive coding Bootcamp. If you work hard, you can be a web developer, and you can realize your own web-based technical ideas and launch it to the market. There are tons of materials on the internet, all we need are a strong will and energy to put persistent effort. If we do together, it could be much easier to be persistent. Let's do it together.
